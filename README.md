# mewo: a discord bot created using the nextcord api :3c
### preface: if you've got any criticisms, bad words to call me, etc. regarding my code, please feel free to message me @ cassidyyy on discord :D <br>
hi!!! i'm coming at this silly project semi-new to python (have experience, just not a lot) and entirely new to nextcord/discord.py. some of the random code in there excluding a specific guild ID is to just stop some of the code working in a server i currently have the bot in. this will be an entirely unserious repo and creation, but id like to be able to learn and grow from what i learn doing this :)
this is just a little passion project to get me back on my feet again while i start my compsci degree, and preferably away from C. *as far as possible from C..*

anyway, stick around, have a coffee, and maybe ill publish something worth looking at in this repo as i go along! ^-^

## currently implemented features
* autoresponse (tests, but these will remain because i think they're funny)
> includes: guild/dm detection (still a WIP but it does work), responses (kind of necessary if it's... an auto*responder*...
* reaction alerts for messages (intended for a future auto-mod log type thing, i was kind of just testing things when i made this)
> includes username, link to message, and link to emoji (if custom, also detects if the emoji is custom and prints the emoji twice if not, link if is).

## to be added
* ill add this later, have to look at the trello board first.
> actually,, cant i just link the trello board... idk its 3am im eepy.

note: IGNORE THE STATUS I HAVE SET FOR IT THE BOTS CALLED HOUSE MD RIGHT NOW I THOUGHT IT WAS A FUNNY WAY TO LEARN HOW TO ASSIGN CUSTOM STATUSES :sob:
